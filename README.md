# Guestbook for ` emresarac.com.tr ` - Git tutorial

This is the public GitHub project that you can contribute to.

# Leave a message for me!
This repository is meant to be a place where our users can leave messages for others to see.

You can see the result here: https://emresarac.com.tr/guestbook/

We generally only have one condition: 
I will not allow messages that are negative, or hurtful. Try to be welcome and positive! :)

# What should my message look like?

You can add almost anything to the index.html file between the indicated comments:

```html
<!-- Insert your message below here -->

(write code here)

<!-- End user messages -->
```
So feel free to use your imagination!

If you are not feeling very creative, you can add a quote, or small text
And add your name to it :)

# My change was not approved :(

I reserve the right to remove, or not to add anything that we feel will not fit here.
